[SERP Scraper API](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/serp) is a robust tool built to extract large volumes of public data from the leading search engines in real-time mode. With coordinate-level precision, you can use SERP Scraper API to access different search engines’ pages, such as regular search, hotel availability, keyword page, and other data types. SERP Scraper API is optimal for many business cases, including ads data tracking, brand monitoring, and others.

Read this Quick Start Guide to learn about SERP Scraper API, its technical features, how it works, and how to get started.

For a detailed explanation, see our [blog post](https://oxylabs.io/blog/serp-scraper-api-quick-start-guide).

## Authentication

SERP Scraper API uses basic HTTP authentication that requires a username and password:

```shell
curl --user "USERNAME:PASSWORD" 'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"source": "SEARCH_ENGINE_search", "domain": "com", "query": "shoes"}'
```

## Integration methods

SERP Scraper API offers three main integration methods: Push-Pull, Realtime, and Proxy Endpoint, each of which has unique benefits.

### Push-pull  

**Example of a single query request:**

```python
curl --user "USERNAME:PASSWORD" 'https://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"source": "SERP_SCRAPER_API_SOURCE", "domain": "com", "query": "shoes", "geo_location": "United States"}'
```

The most popular search engine also supports data parsing out of the box. If you wish to get parsed and structured data instead of an HTML document of the page, please add `"parse": true` as a parameter.

**Sample of the initial response output:** 

```json
{
  "callback_url": null,
  "client_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2021-09-30 12:11:22",
  "domain": "com",
  "geo_location": "United States",
  "id": "6849314714636265473",
  "limit": 10,
  "locale": null,
  "pages": 1,
  "parse": false,
  "parser_type": null,
  "render": null,
  "url": null,
  "query": "shoes",
  "source": "SERP_SCRAPER_API_SOURCE",
  "start_page": 1,
  "status": "pending",
  "storage_type": null,
  "storage_url": null,
  "subdomain": "www",
  "content_encoding": "utf-8",
  "updated_at": "2021-09-30 12:11:22",
  "user_agent_type": "desktop",
  "session_info": null,
  "statuses": [],
  "_links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/6849314714636265473",
      "method": "GET"
    },
    {
      "rel": "results",
      "href": "http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/6849314714636265473/results",
      "method": "GET"
    }
  ]
}
```

The initial response indicates that the job’s scrape-specific website has been created in our system.

In order to check whether the job is `"status": "done"`, you can use the link from `["_links"][0]["href"]`, which is *http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/6849314714636265473*.

**Example of how to check job status:**

```shell
curl --user "USERNAME:PASSWORD" 'http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/6849314714636265473'
```

The response will contain the same data as the initial response. If the job is `"status": "done"`, you can retrieve the contents using the link from `["_links"][1]["href"]`, which is *http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/6849314714636265473/results*.

**Example of how to retrieve data:**

```
curl --user "USERNAME:PASSWORD" 'http://data.oxylabs.io/v1/queries/6849314714636265473/results'
```

**Sample of the response HTML data output:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "<html>CONTENT</html>"
      "created_at": "2021-09-30 12:11:22",
      "updated_at": "2021-09-30 12:11:30",
      "page": 1,
      "url": "SEARCH_ENGINE_URL",
      "job_id": "6849314714636265473",
      "status_code": 200,
    }
  ]
}
```

**Sample of the response parsed data output in JSON:**

```json

    "results": [
        {
        "content": {
          "url": "SEARCH_ENGINE_URL",
